## 📚 Appendix

### Understanding Mutation Testing

Mutation testing validates test quality by introducing small bugs (mutations) into your code:

1. **🟢 Killed Mutants**: Tests detected the bug ✅ Good!
2. **❌ Survived Mutants**: Tests missed the bug ❌ Need better tests  
3. **🚫 No Coverage**: Code isn't tested ❌ Need more tests

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Address High Priority Files**: Focus on files with low coverage or poor mutation scores
2. **Improve Test Assertions**: Strengthen tests to catch survived mutants
3. **Increase Coverage**: Add tests for uncovered code paths
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Run mutation testing in CI/CD pipeline

### Mutation Testing Best Practices

- Target 80%+ mutation score for critical code
- Focus on business logic and edge cases
- Use mutation testing to guide test improvements
- Don't aim for 100% - some mutants are equivalent
